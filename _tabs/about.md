Good day! Welcome to my blog!

I mainly write about [Meelo](https://github.com/Arthi-chaud/Meelo), web development and functional programming (yeah, I'm that kind of person).

I graduated from EPITECH (France) in 2024, and started a PhD in the UK a couple of months later.
I have experience in low-level programming, OOP and functional programming, and web (full-stack).

Currently using macOS, I've been using Linux (Fedora, Manjaro/Arch) for 4 years.
I fell into the system configuration world, and carry my dotfiles everywhere I go.

Using neovim, btw :)

You can find my socials somewhere at in the navigation bar. Feel free to reach out!

Oh and you can find by CV [here](https://github.com/Arthi-chaud/Curriculum-Vitae/releases)

Cheers!

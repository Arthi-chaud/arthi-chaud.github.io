Good day! Welcome to my blog!

I mainly write about [Meelo](https://github.com/Arthi-chaud/Meelo), web development and functional programming.

I graduated from EPITECH (France) in 2024, and started a PhD in the UK a couple of months later.
Currently in my second year, my research focuses on meta-programming, programs' performance and type-safety.
I have experience in low-level, object-oriented and functional programming. I am also a web developer (full-stack, including design).

Currently using macOS, I've been using Linux (Fedora, Manjaro/Arch) for 4 years.
I fell into the system configuration world, and carry my dotfiles everywhere I go.
(Using neovim, btw :))

You can find my socials somewhere at the bottom of the navigation bar. Feel free to reach out!

Oh and you can find my CV [here](https://github.com/Arthi-chaud/Curriculum-Vitae/releases)

Cheers!

---

I've been working on Meelo for about 3 years now. Recently, it has received a bit of attention because of my post on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42850109), and I am very grateful for that. The thing is, people seem not to understand what the project is _really_ about.

This series of post is my attempt to describe and explain what and who Meelo is for. The project's main features are very niche, and my goal here is to explain why I needed them.

This post will not be very technical. It's more about design and reflection.

## 3-minute-pitch: What is Meelo?

Meelo is a self-hosted music server. It is a software that scans your folder, registers the music files and makes them available to you through a web application.
Yes, it is very much like Plex of Jellyfin. But Meelo stands out through features that either don't exist anywhere else, or are weakly supported.

There is not much else to say. So let's move on, and let me explain what _my_ original needs were.

## Backstory: from iTunes to Plex

When I was a kid, I used to listen to music on my iPod. How do you put music on them? Through iTunes (now just `Music`). It was/is, in my opinion, a very good software for managing your music libraries. Its info menu felt very complete and easy to understand. I would spend hours trying to organise my music as much as possible. I was exposed to a lot of different genres very early on, so my music 'collection' at the time has already a couple of hundred songs.

![iTunes Menu](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.idownloadblog.com%2F2019%2F04%2F10%2Fdetails-song-info-itunes-apple-music%2F&psig=AOvVaw16gKwCHGStwN9-hjHa-_-T&ust=1738267321113000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKCEhsPcm4sDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE){: .right }

As years went by, streaming services became more and more popular. Managing music files felt like it was not the 'right' way to manage your music library. Clicking on a simple 'add' button on Spotify/Apple Music was _the_ way to go.

(Un)fortunately, around the same time, I started to get interested in physical media, especially CDs: they were (are still are!) cheap, easy to take care of, and small (compared to vinyl records). I discovered [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/my), which is (imo) the best database for music releases: it catalogues every different version for each album, single etc. (For example, checkout how many different pressings there are for [_Hung Up_ by Madonna](https://www.discogs.com/master/34539-Madonna-Hung-Up)). For some reason, this is very interesting to me. Fatally, I started collecting[^collecting] physical media (mainly CDs), because it felt nice to hold something in your hands with nice pictures, funny notes in the booklet or the credits.

At the time, the content of CD Singles (a CD that is not an album, 'focusing' only on one song), would still be exclusive to the physical realm. Remixes and B-Sides were nowhere to be seen on streaming services (This is less true today, as some labels start to make them available on there). I have a weak spot for these rarities.
Consequently, I started having more and more CDs, and sometimes multiple versions of the same album/single (e.g. _Music_ has three different tracklist depending on the country the CD was released in [1](https://www.discogs.com/release/14008-Madonna-Music) [2](https://www.discogs.com/release/690460-Madonna-Music) [3](https://www.discogs.com/release/36224-Madonna-Music)).

With more and more tracks only available on CD, and no more iPod to play them on, I wanted to be able to access the files on my smartphone. And I discovered Plex. I think it's a great piece of software (for music at least). And for a while, I was happy with it (tbh, I still am, Plexamp is an amazing app).

## Limitations of music software

Software like iTunes, Plex, Jellyfin, etc. all handle data related to music similarly: Artists have albums, albums have songs. Songs are unique to the album they belong to. If a same song with the same name appears on two different albums, then it's not the same song. Similarly, two albums versions cannot be just _one_ album.

So this design has a few limitations:

- When a song appears on an album and a 'greatest-hits'-like album, the song would be listed twice in a global song list
- When you have two versions of a single album (e.g. the _standard_ version and the _deluxe_ edition), these cannot be linked. Thus, in a global album list, both versions would be listed [^album-versions-plex].

When you don't collect music, it's easy to deal with these limitations and ignore them. But when the same song appears on 5 different albums, it is getting problematic.
At the end of the day, what I wanted is a music player/server that modeled data like Discogs and [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).

Does such solution exist? Well if it did, I never found it. That's how Meelo was born.

## The design of Meelo

The goal of Meelo would be handle music files so that:

- Albums would have _releases_ (A release being a version of an album)
  - There would be a _main_ release (the main _instance_ of an album)
- And similarly for songs: they would have _tracks_
  - There would be a _main_ track (the main _instance_ of the song)
- And basic features like browsing, playback, etc.

Meelo is meant to be personal, it's _your_ collection, so even though it has a user management system, it's not meant to be shared with people you do not know (please don't share music illegally x).

## Conclusion

Meelo was born from a need I think many music collectors have. The software was not created to answer a general need, but a specific one.
I hope this insight helped you understand the original ideas behind the software. Feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Arthi-chaud/Meelo)!


[^collectiong]: See _collecting_ as a way to honour the music you like and the artist you appreciate. The goal is not to have as many items as possible.
[^album-versions-plex]: I found out that Plex had some kind of hidden album version detection, but it is not very evident/clear how it works.
